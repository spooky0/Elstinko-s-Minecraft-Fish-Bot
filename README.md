# Elstinko-s-Fish-Bot Any Minecraft Version
Just a small sound activated fish bot.


Important Notes:

You will not be able to use your computer for other tasks while this bot runs, it requires the game to be in focus and have access to your mouse.

This bot runs via the sound coming from the game.
When a fish bites the lure, the sound in-game peaks.
If the bot is running and the sound peaks, then the bot sends a virtual mouse signal to Right Click and attempt to catch the fish.
This means you will need to have other applications muted and that you will want to find a quiet place in-game to fish.
Turn of all in-game sounds except sound effects for this to work best.



To run Elstinko's Fish Bot:

1. Open the EXE found in the same folder as this readme file: "Elstinko's Fish Bot".  You may need to run as administrator.

2. In the drop down on the top of the application select which device outputs your sound

3. Open the game you want to fish in

4. Manually fish for a bit and watch the sound meter in the bot

5. Adjust the slider to be just below where the sound meter peaks 
(Too far left and the bot will reel in more reliably but you run the risk of other sounds triggering the reel in)
(Too far right and other sounds are less likely to trigger the reel in but the bot has a higher chance of missing a fish)
(You may need to fiddle with this depending on what you prefer)

6. Click "Start Bot" and quickly move your mouse back to the game
